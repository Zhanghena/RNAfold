# RNAfold
## The full-length transcripts containing an m5C candidate were extracted and subjected to secondary structure analysis using RNAfold of the ViennaRNA package.
### Calculate the maximum expected accuracy (MEA) structure at 75 Â°C (the temperature of the bisulfite conversion reaction) using a gamma of 0.1. The maximum allowed distance between two bases in a pair was set to 150 nt to keep a reasonable computation time. 
### Sites that were predicted to be base-paired(base-pair probability>=0.9) in the resulting structure were retained.
### And transform the transcript position to genomic position.
